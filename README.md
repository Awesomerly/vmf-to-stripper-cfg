# Stripper File Assistant

Takes two VMFs and converts the differences between entities to a Stripper:Source (I didn't come up with the name) config file for use on servers. This was inspired by a friend's project.

### Todo:

- [ ] diff connections
- [ ] create lasers around brushes when in visgroup
- [ ] annotate output better for readability
